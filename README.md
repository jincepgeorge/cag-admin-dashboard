## Switching Between Mock and Firebase

### Using Mock Data (Default)
No configuration needed. The app works with local mock data out of the box.

### Switching to Firebase
Run the provided script:
```bash
./switch-to-firebase.sh
```

This automatically updates all service imports throughout the application.

### Manual Switch
Replace import statements from:
```javascript
import memberService from '../services/memberService';
```
To:
```javascript
import memberService from '../services/memberService.firebase';
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
```

See [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](./FIREBASE_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Deployment

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Deploy to Firebase Hosting (Optional)
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
