## 💻 Using the Services

### All Services Work Identically!
Whether using mock data or Firebase, the API is the same:

```javascript
// Member Operations
const members = await memberService.getMembers();
const member = await memberService.getMemberById(id);
const newMember = await memberService.createMember(data);
const updated = await memberService.updateMember(id, data);
await memberService.deleteMember(id);

// Portal Credentials
await memberService.generateMemberCredentials(memberId);
await memberService.resetMemberCredentials(memberId);
await memberService.revokeMemberAccess(memberId);

// Event Operations
const events = await eventService.getEvents();
const event = await eventService.createEvent(data);
await eventService.updateEvent(id, data);
await eventService.deleteEvent(id);

// Donation Operations
const donations = await donationService.getDonations();
const stats = await donationService.getDonationStats();
const memberDonations = await donationService.getDonationsByMember(memberId);
await donationService.createDonation(data);

// Authentication
const { user, token } = await authService.login(email, password);
await authService.register(userData);
await authService.logout();
const currentUser = await authService.getCurrentUser();

// Notifications
const notifications = await notificationService.getNotifications();
const unread = await notificationService.getUnreadNotifications(userId);
await notificationService.markAsRead(notificationId);
await notificationService.createNotification(data);
```

## 🔒 Security

### Development (Current)
```javascript
// Firestore Rules (Test Mode)
allow read, write: if true;  // Anyone can read/write
```
✅ Good for: Development and testing  
⚠️ **Not secure** for production

### Production
```javascript
// Recommended Firestore Rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /members/{memberId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && isAdmin();
    }
    // Similar rules for other collections
  }
}
```

See `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` for complete security rules.

## 💰 Cost

### Firebase Free Tier (Spark Plan)
```
✅ Authentication:     50,000 users/month
✅ Firestore Reads:    50,000/day
✅ Firestore Writes:   20,000/day
✅ Firestore Deletes:  20,000/day
✅ Storage:            1 GB
✅ Hosting:            10 GB/month transfer
```

**Estimated for small church:**
- 100 members × 30 logins/month = 3,000 reads
- 50 donations/month = 100 writes
- Well within free tier! 💚
